<p>They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22
years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were
either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned
bridge.  Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job
to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them,
but embarrass them in the process. I'm gonna hang out with these two
smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be
lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. They will lose the rest of
their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives.
So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring
me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there.
WINNING!   100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in
your mouth. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total

it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his
victims. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The
Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it.
Losers! WINNING! B'bye.    Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18,
Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching
the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they
wanted to and those people were in their way. .... And then, I just got to
add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you
know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm
gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye,
Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly...
So ....</p>
